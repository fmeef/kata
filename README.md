# Kata: openpgp web of trust for the masses

Kata is an experimetal cross-platform openpgp client with an emphasis on web-of-trust, identity verification, and proof-of-humanity via social media profiles.  
Kata does not aim to be a fully functional openpgp client, especially for encryption purposes, but it is fully compatible with legacy clients for certification and WoT.

Kata is under heavy development, many features may have rough edges.
